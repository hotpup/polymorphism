/**

 *
 * Cat and Dog are subclasses of Pet
 * PetFactory provides an abstraction for CatFactory, DogFactory, etc
 * All Pet objects are created through static function Pet::create
 * Subclasses of Pet are responsible for registering themselves
 * Each subclass has its own factory which is kept in a static variable in the
 * getMap() function of of Pet class
 *
 * For instructional simplicity, it is all in a single file
 * Once you understand the example, each class should get its own file
